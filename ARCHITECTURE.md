# SMM Platform — Architecture

Technical documentation for developers. It explains how the platform is
structured, how each subsystem works, and the design decisions behind it. For
product/usage docs see [README.md](README.md); for the dev workflow see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **Platform:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), TypeScript, deployed as a
  standalone Docker image on DockHost.
- **Size:** ~2k lines of TypeScript across `app/src`, one Postgres database,
  one container.
- **Philosophy:** *spec-first, one roadmap item at a time*. Every feature is
  built against an explicit `done_when` criterion tracked in `roadmap.json`,
  with business logic developed test-first (Vitest) wherever it isn't a thin
  wrapper around an external API or the database.

## 1. High-level flow

```
Browser ──► proxy.ts (rate limit + auth gate) ──► Next.js route / page
                                                        │

                                                                                    │
                                                                                    ▼
                                                                        src/instrumentation.ts
                                                                        (auto-renews tokens <7d from expiry)
```

The unit of work is a **roadmap task** (`F1`, `IG2`, …). Each one lands as a
small set of commits on `dev`, gets merged to `main` on explicit request, and
is marked `done` in `roadmap.json` only once its `done_when` is verified.

## 2. Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), TypeScript | Server components for panel pages, Route Handlers for API/OAuth |
| Auth | NextAuth v5 (Auth.js), Credentials provider, JWT sessions | Email/password login for panel staff; `trustHost: true` required behind DockHost's reverse proxy |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Prisma (`prisma-client` generator, driver adapter `@prisma/adapter-pg`) | Prisma 7 requires an explicit driver adapter — no implicit connection via the schema `url` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, Inter (Cyrillic-supporting) | Design tokens in `globals.css` (`--color-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`) |
| Testing | Vitest | Pure business logic tested via dependency injection at the seams (DB calls, external API calls injected, not mocked in-place) |
| Instagram integration | Instagram API with Instagram Login (OAuth), Graph API for token exchange/refresh | No Facebook Login/page linkage needed for a single account |
| Deployment | Docker (multi-stage: builder, prisma-tools, runner) on DockHost | Standalone Next.js output; `entrypoint.sh` runs `prisma migrate deploy` + conditional seed on every boot |
| Uptime | Scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/uptime-smm.yml`) | Pings prod every 10 min; a failed run triggers GitHub's built-in failure email — no extra infra |
| Auto-renewal | In-process `setInterval` in `src/instrumentation.ts` | The Next.js standalone server is already a long-lived process; avoids standing up a second scheduler for one job |
| Content polling | Several independent `setInterval`s in `src/instrumentation.ts` (media 15min, comments 5min, metrics 2h, story metrics 1h) | Instagram webhooks aren't reliably delivered in dev; same "no extra scheduler" reasoning as token auto-renewal, one interval per data cadence |

## 3. Source layout

All application code lives in `app/src`.

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `proxy.ts` | Next.js 16 middleware-equivalent. Rate-limits every `/api/*` request (global 100/min, stricter 10/min on the credentials login callback); delegates `/panel/*` auth gating to NextAuth's `authorized` callback. |
| `auth.ts` | NextAuth config: Credentials provider, Prisma adapter, JWT session callbacks, `trustHost: true`. |
| `instrumentation.ts` | Runs once on server boot: starts a 6-hour interval that refreshes any `InstagramAccount` token expiring within 7 days. |
| `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` | NextAuth's own route handlers. |
| `app/api/instagram/authorize/route.ts` | Redirects to Instagram's OAuth authorize URL (Track A scopes only), sets a CSRF `state` cookie. |
| `app/api/instagram/callback/route.ts` | Validates `state`, exchanges the code for a long-lived token via `instagramOAuth.ts`, stores it encrypted. |
| `app/panel/*` | Server-rendered panel pages: `connections`, `users` (admin-only), `profile`, `analytics` (multi-account charts/table/demographics), `scenarios` (admin-only AI agent core: tone, knowledge base, examples, sandbox), plus stubs for modules not yet built (`inbox`, `content`). Each mutable page pairs with an `actions.ts` (server actions). |
| `lib/instagramOAuth.ts` | Pure, dependency-injected OAuth orchestration: `buildAuthorizeUrl`, `connectInstagramAccount`, `refreshAccountToken`, `daysUntilExpiry`. The real Instagram API calls are injected as an `InstagramApiClient`, so this is fully unit-tested without hitting the network. |
| `lib/instagramApiClient.ts` | The real `InstagramApiClient` implementation (`fetch` calls to `api.instagram.com` / `graph.instagram.com`). Not unit-tested — same boundary treatment as `prisma.ts`. |
| `lib/encryption.ts` | AES-256-GCM `encrypt`/`decrypt`, key passed as a parameter (never read from `process.env` inside the function) — used to store the Instagram access token. |
| `lib/verifyWebhookSignature.ts` | HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`sha256=<hex>`, matching Meta's `X-Hub-Signature-256`). Built ahead of any real webhook endpoint, for the future Instagram Direct/Track B work. |
| `lib/rateLimiter.ts` | In-memory, fixed-window rate limiter (`Map`-based, per process). Not shared across replicas — revisit if `smm` ever scales beyond one. |
| `lib/verifyCredentials.ts`, `changePassword.ts`, `createUser.ts`, `setUserActive.ts` | Panel auth/user-management business logic, each paired with a `.test.ts`. |
| `lib/claudeApiKey.ts` | Pure, dependency-injected logic for saving the platform's Claude API key: verifies it against the real API, then encrypts it. The verification client is injected (`ClaudeApiClient`), so this is unit-tested without a real key or network call. |
| `lib/claudeApiClient.ts` | The real `ClaudeApiClient` implementation — calls Anthropic's `GET /v1/models` (cheap, no token cost) to check the key is valid. Not unit-tested, same boundary treatment as `instagramApiClient.ts`. |
| `lib/instagramPoller.ts` | Pure normalization functions for the content poller: `normalizeMedia`, `normalizeComment`, `flattenInsights`, `buildMetricSnapshot`, `isActiveStory`, `normalizeFollowerCount`, `shouldFetchDemographics`, `buildDemographicsMetrics`, `dailyHistory` (groups snapshots into one-per-calendar-day, also the fallback for expired stories). Fully unit-tested against fixture Graph API payloads — no network or DB. |
| `lib/instagramContentClient.ts` | The real Graph API calls (`graph.instagram.com/me/media`, `/{media-id}/comments`, `/me/insights`, `/{media-id}/insights`, `/me` for follower count, demographics breakdown insights). Not unit-tested, same boundary treatment as `instagramApiClient.ts`. |
| `lib/analyticsDashboard.ts` | Pure read-side functions for the analytics dashboard: `buildAccountMetricCharts`/`buildMetricSeries` (per-metric Recharts series from `dailyHistory()` output), `buildMediaTableRows` (attaches latest metric snapshot to each media row), `parseAgeGenderBreakdown`/`parseGeographyBreakdown` (unpack Meta's nested `total_value.breakdowns[].results[]` demographics shape into chart-ready bars). Fully unit-tested against fixture payloads — no network or DB, mirrors the poller/client split (`instagramPoller.ts` = write-side, this = read-side). |
| `lib/analyticsSummary.ts` | Pure functions for the period summary (data prep for the AN4 AI analysis): `resolvePeriodRange` (preset or custom → current + equal-length previous range), `buildMetricDeltas` (flow metrics summed, the `followerCount` stock metric compared by last value), `rankMedia`/`buildWeekdayPattern`/`buildTimeOfDayPattern` (FEED/REELS only, ranked by `total_interactions`, time buckets gated at 3+ samples), `detectAnomalies` (day deviates >50% from the period average, gated at 4+ data points). Fully unit-tested, no DB access. |
| `lib/analysisReport.ts` | Pure functions for the AI analysis feature (AN4): `serializeSummaryForPrompt`/`buildAnalysisPrompt` (turn a `PeriodSummary` into the prompt sent to Claude), `shouldSkipManualAnalysis` (5-minute cooldown per account+period), `isDigestDue` (7-day gate for the weekly digest), `parseAnalysisContent` (defensive validation of Claude's structured response). Fully unit-tested. |
| `lib/claudeAnalysisClient.ts` | The real call to `claude-sonnet-5` (`POST /v1/messages` via `fetch`, matching `claudeApiClient.ts`'s boundary treatment) with `output_config.format` (JSON Schema: `summary`/`observations`/`recommendations`) and an anti-hallucination system prompt. Not unit-tested. |
| `lib/agentPrompt.ts` | Pure functions for the AI agent core (AG1): `buildSystemPrompt` (assembles tone/rules + knowledge base documents + example dialogues into one system prompt; the no-prices/no-closing-deals rule is always baked in, not admin-editable), `buildConversationMessages` (dialogue turns → Claude's `user`/`assistant` message array). Fully unit-tested. |
| `lib/agentSandbox.ts` | Pure function `canSaveAsExample` (AG1): blocks saving a sandbox dialogue as a reusable example if any agent turn in it was rated 👎. Fully unit-tested. |
| `lib/agentClient.ts` | The real call to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (`POST /v1/messages` via `fetch`) for the agent's conversational replies — no tool use, no structured output, just a plain text response. Not unit-tested, same boundary treatment as `claudeAnalysisClient.ts`. |
| `lib/prisma.ts` | Prisma client singleton, constructed with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter. |
| `components/*` | Client components for panel interactivity (forms, toggles, nav) — thin, calling server actions via `useTransition`. |

## 4. Data model

Prisma models (`app/prisma/schema.prisma`):

- **`User`** — panel accounts (`email`, `passwordHash`, `role`, `isActive`).
- **`InstagramAccount`** — one row per connected Instagram account
  (`instagramUserId`, `username`, `accessToken` — encrypted, `tokenExpiresAt`,
  `connectedByUserId`). Designed for **multiple** accounts from the start, even
  though the first customer only needs one.
- **`ClaudeApiKeyConfig`** — a singleton row (`singleton: "claude"`) holding
  the platform's own Claude API key, encrypted, plus `verified`/`verifiedAt`.
  Global rather than per-user: the key powers server-side AI features (analytics,
  content, auto-replies), not a per-account external login like Instagram.
- **`InstagramMedia`** / **`InstagramComment`** — one row per post/Reel/story
  and per comment, deduped by their Instagram ID (upsert on poll). Current-state
  entities, not history — engagement counts are overwritten on each poll.
- **`InstagramMetricSnapshot`** — append-only: one row per poll per
  account/media, `scope` (`account`/`media`/`story`/`demographics`) + a
  `metrics` JSON blob + `capturedAt`. Raw timestamped snapshots;
  `dailyHistory()` turns these into one-per-day trend points on read, rather
  than this table itself being pre-aggregated history. `demographics`
  snapshots only exist once the account has 100+ followers (Meta's own
  threshold); follower growth is derived from day-over-day `followerCount`
  deltas in `account`-scope snapshots, not a separate metric.
- **`AiAnalysisReport`** — append-only, one row per AI analysis run
  (`trigger`: `manual`/`weekly`, `content` JSON: `summary`/`observations`/
  `recommendations`, `periodFrom`/`periodTo`). Never overwritten — past
  reports stay visible in the panel.
- **`AgentConfig`** — a singleton row (`singleton: "agent"`) holding the AI
  agent's tone and rules as free text. One shared config, not per-channel —
  channel-specific overlays are deferred to the tasks that actually wire up
  a channel (`CM1`, `DM1`, `WEB5`).
- **`AgentKnowledgeDocument`** — freeform `title`+`body` documents (tour
  catalog, conditions, FAQs). No search/RAG — at this scale every document
  is concatenated straight into the system prompt.
- **`AgentExampleDialogue`** — full multi-turn dialogues (`turns` JSON:
  `{role, content}[]`) used as few-shot examples in the system prompt.
  Promoted from a sandbox session once every agent turn in it has been
  rated 👍 (or left unrated) — never if any turn was rated 👎.
- **`AgentSandboxSession`** — a draft conversation (`turns` JSON, per-turn
  `rating`, `status`: `draft`/`saved`) persisted to the DB from the first
  message, not just client-side React state — a page reload doesn't lose
  test progress.

## 5. Key decisions

- **Polling over webhooks for now.** Instagram webhooks aren't reliably delivered
  in development mode, and the roadmap's `IG3` is explicitly a poller. Webhook
  signature verification (`verifyWebhookSignature.ts`) was still built early
  (`F3`) as a reusable primitive, ahead of the endpoint that will eventually use it.
- **In-memory rate limiting, not Redis.** The app runs a single replica on
  DockHost; adding a shared store now would be premature. Documented as a thing
  to revisit if `smm` ever scales horizontally.
- **`--docker-file` in DockHost is relative to the repo root, not
  `--docker-context`** — the opposite of what the flag names suggest, and the
  root cause of a long deploy outage. When `dockerContext: app`, the flag must
  be `app/Dockerfile`, not `Dockerfile`.
- **`dockhost container update --image ...` replaces the full container spec**
  if `--variable`/`--port` are omitted, not just the image. Always pass the
  complete variable list and port when updating an existing container via the
  CLI, or use the dashboard's per-field edit instead.
- **DockHost auto-rebuilds `smm` on every push to `main`** — no need to run
  `dockhost repository build` manually; just push and check
  `dockhost container list`/`dockhost container logs smm` after a minute or two.
- **Instagram API with Instagram Login addresses the token's own account via
  `/me`, not its own ID.** `GET /{instagramUserId}/media` and `/insights`
  return a `code 100 / subcode 33` "object does not exist" error even with a
  valid token; `GET /me/media` and `/me/insights` work. Found by deploying the
  IG3 poller against a real connected account — media-level and comment-level
  calls (`/{media-id}/...`) are unaffected since they address the object's own
  ID, not the account's.
- **Graph API metric names drift between versions without notice.** A live
  deploy of AN1's Reels insights call failed with `metric[5] must be one of
  the following values: ...` — `plays` had been renamed to `views`. The error
  message lists the full valid metric set for that media type, which is the
  fastest way to fix it; treat any new insights metric added here as
  unverified until it's been exercised against a real account at least once.
- **Recharts for the analytics dashboard.** First charting dependency in the
  project (React 19 compatible). Chosen over hand-rolled SVG for the built-in
  tooltips/responsive containers that `AN2`'s "one chart per collected metric"
  scope needed.
- **Read-side data shaping lives in `lib/analyticsDashboard.ts`, separate from
  the poller's write-side `lib/instagramPoller.ts`.** Same pure-function/DI
  pattern, just facing the other direction: takes already-queried Prisma rows
  and reshapes them for the UI, never touches the database itself.
- **Meta's demographics breakdown shape, confirmed on real data.** AN1 stored
  the raw `total_value.breakdowns[].results[]` structure without ever
  rendering it; `AN2`'s parsers assumed the documented shape and were verified
  against the real `@chuck_uz` response after deploy — it matched, no fix
  needed.
- **Format dates in a fixed timezone (UTC), never the ambient one.**
  `MediaTable` (a client component, browser-rendered) and `SummaryPanel` (a
  server component, container-rendered) both called `toLocaleDateString`
  without a `timeZone` option and showed *different calendar dates for the
  same publication* — one used the browser's local timezone, the other the
  container's. Fixed by passing `timeZone: "UTC"` explicitly in both places,
  matching `dailyHistory()`'s and the weekday/time-of-day bucketing's
  existing UTC convention. Any new date-formatting call in this codebase
  should do the same.
- **Structured output over free-form text for the AI analysis (AN4).**
  `claudeAnalysisClient.ts` uses `output_config.format` (JSON Schema) instead
  of asking Claude for markdown and parsing it — guarantees a shape that maps
  directly onto `AiAnalysisReport.content`, with `parseAnalysisContent()` as
  a defensive fallback in case a response still doesn't validate.
- **No day/time pinning for the weekly digest.** Rather than a cron-like
  "every Monday 9am", the digest interval in `instrumentation.ts` just checks
  every 6 hours whether the last `weekly` report for an account is 7+ days
  old — same "no extra scheduler" reasoning as the other pollers, and avoids
  timezone/DST edge cases for a single weekly email-equivalent.
- **The AI agent (AG1) replies with a single plain `messages.create` call,
  no tool use.** The whole context (system prompt + full conversation
  history) is sent on every turn; there's no need for the model to fetch
  anything mid-turn since the knowledge base is small enough to live in the
  prompt directly.
- **Full multi-turn dialogues as examples, not single exchange pairs.**
  A deliberate choice during AG1's design: storing the whole dialogue (not
  just one client-message/agent-reply pair) preserves conversational flow
  as a few-shot pattern, at the cost of per-turn (not per-dialogue) 👍/👎
  rating to decide whether the dialogue is eligible to be saved at all.
- **`/panel/scenarios` (the AI agent core) is admin-only**, same as
  `/panel/users` — it's a system-wide configuration of the bot's behavior,
  not a manager's day-to-day tool. The nav item was moved out of the shared
  module list into the admin-gated section of `PanelNav`.
